% Part 1 - Git Hub

% I made a github account with my valid boise state URL 
% Cloned the master branch into my local directory 
% Also made a new breanch called GEOS397_Zylka

% i would go about this in understanding what language i would have to put
% into matlab to obtain the results that i wanted, i would run a loop that
% constrains me, as being a 1, and put in constraints saying that 'me' can
% only be assigned to each other varible once. a combination funcation?
% where a=(1,2)......a=(1,3).....etc.... so after my script runs i would
% have nine rows and 2 columns until all combinations were met with.






%%
%integer_ whole numbers
%example would be a=1 
%this helps save execution time and memory if you use the
%smallest integer type for your data

%double- Decimals, but this will tend to use more data
%thus increasing memory
%example- 28.4726

%string- text. varibles will be store as a text
%example (a='myname')

%structure- an array structure will group related date using containers 
%called fields.
%youll use dot notarion to access date of the form
%structName.fieldName





%%
% Varibles with a large scope should have a useful name.
% Variables with a small scope can have shorter names.
% Varibles should use the convention "firstSecondThirdEtc. where the 
%variable name is descriptive enough, having the first word lowercase, and
%capitalizing each subsequent word afterwords.
% In the case for constants, underscores may be used in conjuntion with all
%uppercase letters; example LIKE_THIS 
% A Structure should havbe a capitalized leading word, followed by all 
%lowercase letters; example Like.this
